This week we have drilled a 1.5 meter plank of wood into the base of the robot, which will serve as the foundation of the robot's body.

This week we have build the lower body of the robot using cardboard. We have also glued a small piece of wood in the side of the cardboard, which is where the servo motor will be located at. The next stage will be to build the top of the body, which will have the attached servo motor for the lever, and ideally the "screen" of the slot machine.

This week we have attached the servo motor to the wood piece in the body of our robot, which will serve as the lever of the robot. For now we are using a temporary prototype of the lever made out of glued styrofoam, but we are planning on building the actual lever soon, possibly made out of wood.

This week I am travelling during the Fall break, so no work will be done in the body of the robot.
