This week we have finished building and soldering the entire robot's wheel base, as well as sucessfully testing it with code.

This week we have drilled a 1.5 meter plank of wood into the base of the robot, which will serve as the foundation of the robot's body.

This week we have build the lower body of the robot using cardboard. We have also glued a small piece of wood in the side of the cardboard, which is where the servo motor will be located at. The next stage will be to build the top of the body, which will have the attached servo motor for the lever, and ideally the "screen" of the slot machine.

This week we have attached the servo motor to the wood piece in the body of our robot, which will serve as the lever of the robot. For now we are using a temporary prototype of the lever made out of glued styrofoam, but we are planning on building the actual lever soon, possibly made out of wood.

This week I am travelling during the Fall break, so no work will be done in the body of the robot.

## 23/10/2025

This week we have:
* Finished building most of the robot's body using cardboard
* Replaced the servo motor with a working one (the first one was most likely not working because of the extenders, not because of the motor itself)
* Attached the crank to the servo motor
* Attached the glass dome to the top of the robot to use the NeoPixels lights

What we will accomplish by this Thursday (30/10):
* Connect the NeoPixels lights to the Arduino and stick to the glass dome
* Build the "reels screen" functionality of the robot using stepper motors (need to figure out first how to do it with the Professor's help)

Features that remain to be implemented:
* Reel screen
* Document dispenser
